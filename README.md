# Essential Essential Scala Code

This is the code for our [Essential Essential Scala](https://github.com/underscoreio/eescala) workshop. See that repository for full details and course notes.

To get started with the code run `sbt.sh` (OS X and Linux) or `sbt.bat` (Windows) on a system with Java installed.
